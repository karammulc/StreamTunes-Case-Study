## Introduction

# StreamTunes-Case-Study
Background: A major music streaming platform, StreamTunes, aims to enhance its user experience and increase user engagement by leveraging data-driven insights. The company has acquired a comprehensive dataset containing information about the most famous songs of 2023 on Spotify,
including track attributes, popularity, and presence on various music platforms.

#### Tools Used: Google Sheets, BigQuery, R Posit Cloud

Objectives:
- Identify key factors that contribute to a song's popularity and success across different music platforms.
- Develop strategies to optimize StreamTunes' playlist curation and song recommendations based on user preferences and trends.
- Explore opportunities for cross-platform partnerships and promotions to expand StreamTunes' user base and market share.

## Challenges
#### Challenges for this project were relatively limited. 
- Some characters within the dataset were corrupted (ï¿½ instead of letters); this was resolved with the SUBSTITUTE function within sheets.
- There was slight trouble with keeping the streams variable as INT instead of CHR upon upload to posit cloud; but this was fixed to a num conversion within sheets.
- During a review of the dataset discussion, I found that user [paulabsmanner](https://www.kaggle.com/paulabsmanner) identified a corrupted streams value for the song "Love Grows (Where My Rosemary Goes)".
  I located and removed this corrupted record using SQL.
  ###### Big thanks to the Kaggle community for their contributions!
